# pandas-challenge

## Sources

1. Starter Code provided in the asssignments files
2. Our class's discord provided general tips for common errors received by many in the class. This was only used on the pd.cut functions where I originally called directly from the dataframe columns but through discord help realized that I only needed to call from the data used to create the dataframe.
3. Stack Overflow was a great help in reminding me of tolist() which I used for per_school_counts

## Areas for Improvement

1. The district_summary dataframe only works the way it is formatted because each column is a single row. I realized this once working on the other dataframes. I could change the format of this dataframe to match the others.
2. Overall, being more careful in which variable I am using because I spent too much time in creating the per_school_summary dataframe due to me inputting the wrong variable for the overall percentage of passing
